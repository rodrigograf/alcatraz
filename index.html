                <h2>Why Support the Cure for Blindness?</h2>
                <p>We all have a story and a cause we hold near and dear to our hearts for one reason or another.  My (Lorie’s) cause chose me the summer of 1989 when I was diagnosed with an incurable, rare, degenerative eye disease called <strong>retinitis pigmentosa</strong> (RP).</p>
                <p>Basically, my retinas are dying.  It is a slow progressive disease and each year my sight becomes a little more constricted.  In my case, the disease started with night blindness, but now also impacts my day vision.  I have little to no peripheral vision, which means I view this world of ours through a tunnel (hence the term tunnel vision).</p>
                <p>I am just one of more than 10 million Americans who suffer vision loss from Retinitis Pigmentosa, Usher Syndrome or Macular Degeneration, which are all incurable at this time.</p>

                <blockquote>
                “Retinal degenerative diseases pose one of the greatest challenges facing ophthalmology today. The death of vision cells, with the intricate and special functions they perform to enable us to see, is a vexing problem that hundreds of topnotch scientists are tackling as we speak. Although we have made progress, we need a tremendous amount of support to drive novel, groundbreaking research to develop treatments and cures for these sight-threatening conditions.”

        <h3>Medical Student, Resident, and Fellow Education</h3>
        <p>By supporting medical student education, donors to That Man May See significantly strengthen the academic and professional stature of UCSF Ophthalmology and the University as a whole, while contributing to the development of the next generation of leading clinicians and scientists devoted to vision research and eye care. <cite>Thomas R. Mazzocco, MD, and members of the Frederick C. Cordes Eye Society</cite></p>
        <h3>Seed Funding for Peer-Reviewed Faculty Research</h3>
        <p>That Man May See donors provide seed funds to initiate new projects with a high potential for success. With demonstrated results, faculty members seek National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. UCSF Ophthalmology ranks fifth in NIH funding nationally. Newly initiated projects this year include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Validation of International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis and Analysis of the Utility of Gene Expression Profiling as a New Diagnostic Criterion</em>, Nisha Acharya, MD, MS, and John A. Gonzales, MD<br />
    This study aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for a particular type of ocular inflammation, currently an important clinical challenge.</li>
            <li><em>Defining the Functional Link between Inflammation and Corneal Neuropathy in Dry Eye Disease</em>, Nancy A. McNamara, OD, PhD<br />
    This project tests the hypothesis that the neural sensory loss in the cornea plays an important pathological role in dry eye. This study intends to improve the management of dry eye and other diseases of the ocular surface.
    </li>
            <li><em>Sanitation, Water, and Instruction in Face Washing for Trachoma</em>, Jeremy D. Keenan, MD, MPH<br />
    This pilot study for a larger clinical trial examines whether a complete set of hygiene intervention protocols is effective for reducing ocular chlamydial infection. This question is of significant interest to the World Health Organization but has not been definitively studied.
    </li>
            <li><em>Improving Outcomes for Patients with Intraocular Melanoma Using Advanced Genetic Tissue Analysis</em>, Bertil E. Damato, MD, PhD, FRCOphth, and Boris C. Bastian, MD, PhD<br />
    This study uses advanced next-generation gene sequencing to identify the most common ocular melanoma with metastatic potential and to serve as a prognostic tool.
    </li>
            <li><em>Extracellular Matrix and Pathogenic Retinal Angiogenesis: Implications for Age-Related Macular Degeneration</em>, Douglas B. Gould, PhD<br />
    Aimed toward breakthroughs for age-related macular degeneration, this study seeks to understand how alterations of the extracellular matrix lead to pathological angiogenesis in the retina.
    </li>
            <li><em>Trials of a Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Mutant Strain as a Live Vaccine</em>, Matilda F. Chan, MD, PhD<br />
    The results of this study have the potential for new HSV vaccines in which genetically engineered forms of virus are used. 
    </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Funds Established and Newly Increased In Perpetuity</h3>
        <h4>Endowed Funds</h4>
        <p>Endowed funds stabilize the long-range financial future of ophthalmology at UCSF and bring recognition to those who provided these funds or whom generous contributors have chosen to honor. This year, two new endowed chairs were established, and one was increased. <cite>Estate of Harvey A. Birsner, MD, Andrew and Cecilia Yau, Theresa M. Caygill</cite></p>
        <h3>Special Fundraising Initiatives Developed by Friends and Family</h3>
