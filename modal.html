    <h2>Programs Supported by Numerous That Man May See Contributors and Identified Major Donors (2013)</h2>
    <h3>Recruitment of New Clinician Researchers and Basic Scientists + Lab Renovations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bertil E. Damato, MD, PhD, FRCOphth, world-renowned ocular oncologist, joined the faculty of the departments of ophthalmology and radiation oncology as professor and director of Ocular Oncology. <cite>Don and Judy McCubbin</cite></li>
        <li>Anthony Thomas Moore, BM, BCh, FRCOphth, FMedSci, joins the UCSF pediatric ophthalmology team this fall, arriving in San Francisco from London, where he built the leading pediatric ophthalmology units in the United Kingdom. <cite>William Randolph Hearst Foundation, The David and Elva Sinai Foundation, Community Foundation of Western Nevada</cite></li>
        <li>Basic Scientists K. Saidas Nair, PhD, and Felice A. Dunn, PhD, bring tremendous energy to UCSF Ophthalmology’s research programs in the areas of glaucoma and retinal degeneration. Recruitment costs included renovation of their laboratories. <cite>Estate of Denise B. Evans</cite></li>
        <li>Search for a world leader in corneal ophthalmology is under way at the Department of Ophthalmology. <cite>Don and Judy McCubbin</cite></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Second Retinopathy of Prematurity Fellowship</h3>
    <p>Applications are being reviewed for the second David and Elva Sinai Foundation retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) research fellow, who will impact local, national, and international ROP screening processes and research progress. <cite>The David and Elva Sinai Foundation</cite></p>
    <h3>Inherited Retinal Degenerations Research</h3>
    <p>Jacque L. Duncan, MD, studies retinal degenerative diseases using a ground-breaking technology, adaptive optics (AO), to rapidly advance this field of research to lead to sight-saving treatments. <cite>Claire Giannini Fund</cite></p>
    <h3>Glaucoma Research</h3>
    <p>Using stem cell technology, researchers have made tremendous progress in their study of the mechanisms of glaucoma – to advance novel diagnostics and treatments. <cite>Ronald and Anita Wornick</cite></p>
    <p>Worldwide glaucoma study is under way to better understand glaucoma mechanisms, improve therapeutic intervention, and develop cost-effective screening protocols and medical and surgical treatments. 
<cite>Fortisure Foundation</cite>
    <h3>Macular Degeneration Research</h3>
    <p>Applying a multifaceted approach to the study of macular degeneration and retinal diseases advances the Department of Ophthalmology’s ability to make a difference for individuals and families who suffer from these debilitating diseases. <cite>Lisa and John Pritzker Family Fund, Lynn Pasternak</cite></p>
    <h3>PROSE Devices for Low-Income Patients</h3>
    <p>The Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) device is a highly customized, transparent cup that fits over the eye and holds a reservoir of fluid against the cornea. This innovative technology, fitted at the Francis I. Proctor Foundation, reduces pain and suffering for grateful cornea patients. <cite>The Sean and Leslie Doherty Family</cite></p>
    <h3>Francis I. Proctor Foundation - International Research in Ophthalmology</h3>
    <p>Gifts toward the Francis I. Proctor Foundation’s general fund, the Peierls International Eye Research Fund, and the Thomas M. Lietman, MD, International Research Program provide hope to save sight and lives worldwide. <cite>Peierls Foundation</cite></p>
    <h3>Medical Student, Resident, and Fellow Education</h3>
    <p>By supporting medical student education, donors to That Man May See significantly strengthen the academic and professional stature of UCSF Ophthalmology and the University as a whole, while contributing to the development of the next generation of leading clinicians and scientists devoted to vision research and eye care. <cite>Thomas R. Mazzocco, MD, and members of the Frederick C. Cordes Eye Society</cite></p>
    <h3>Seed Funding for Peer-Reviewed Faculty Research</h3>
    <p>That Man May See donors provide seed funds to initiate new projects with a high potential for success. With demonstrated results, faculty members seek National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. UCSF Ophthalmology ranks fifth in NIH funding nationally. Newly initiated projects this year include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Validation of International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis and Analysis of the Utility of Gene Expression Profiling as a New Diagnostic Criterion</em>, Nisha Acharya, MD, MS, and John A. Gonzales, MD<br />
This study aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for a particular type of ocular inflammation, currently an important clinical challenge.</li>
        <li><em>Defining the Functional Link between Inflammation and Corneal Neuropathy in Dry Eye Disease</em>, Nancy A. McNamara, OD, PhD<br />
This project tests the hypothesis that the neural sensory loss in the cornea plays an important pathological role in dry eye. This study intends to improve the management of dry eye and other diseases of the ocular surface.
</li>
        <li><em>Sanitation, Water, and Instruction in Face Washing for Trachoma</em>, Jeremy D. Keenan, MD, MPH<br />
This pilot study for a larger clinical trial examines whether a complete set of hygiene intervention protocols is effective for reducing ocular chlamydial infection. This question is of significant interest to the World Health Organization but has not been definitively studied.
</li>
        <li><em>Improving Outcomes for Patients with Intraocular Melanoma Using Advanced Genetic Tissue Analysis</em>, Bertil E. Damato, MD, PhD, FRCOphth, and Boris C. Bastian, MD, PhD<br />
This study uses advanced next-generation gene sequencing to identify the most common ocular melanoma with metastatic potential and to serve as a prognostic tool.
</li>
        <li><em>Extracellular Matrix and Pathogenic Retinal Angiogenesis: Implications for Age-Related Macular Degeneration</em>, Douglas B. Gould, PhD<br />
Aimed toward breakthroughs for age-related macular degeneration, this study seeks to understand how alterations of the extracellular matrix lead to pathological angiogenesis in the retina.
</li>
        <li><em>Trials of a Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Mutant Strain as a Live Vaccine</em>, Matilda F. Chan, MD, PhD<br />
The results of this study have the potential for new HSV vaccines in which genetically engineered forms of virus are used. 
</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Funds Established and Newly Increased In Perpetuity</h3>
    <h4>Endowed Funds</h4>
    <p>Endowed funds stabilize the long-range financial future of ophthalmology at UCSF and bring recognition to those who provided these funds or whom generous contributors have chosen to honor. This year, two new endowed chairs were established, and one was increased. <cite>Estate of Harvey A. Birsner, MD, Andrew and Cecilia Yau, Theresa M. Caygill</cite></p>
    <h3>Special Fundraising Initiatives Developed by Friends and Family</h3>
    <h4>The Augie Fund – Glasses and Specialized Lenses for Children</h4>
    <p>Today, because of the Augie Fund, any vulnerable child treated at UCSF Ophthalmology who needs glasses or specialized lenses can get them - easily and without financial strain on his or her family. <cite>Gerson and Barbara Bakar, Lucinda Watson, the Kimball Foundation, the Wintroub-Hansen family</cite></p>
    <h3>Alcatraz Swim for Sight</h3>
    <p>That Man May See board member Lorie Hirson is passionate about cures for retinal degenerative diseases. She launched the Swim for Sight to raise funds for research and efforts to save sight and lives. <cite>Hirson family</cite></p>
